        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>The quality of content and the attractiveness of an environmental website can create an environmentally friendly attitude before one visits a secured area. Web applications, accessible via browsers over the Internet, have evolved significantly from static repositories to dynamic collaborative platforms. This study highlights advancements in web evaluation and modeling techniques like PROMETHEE II and its role in decision-making.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The World Wide Web transitioned from static, non-interactive Web 1.0 into dynamic Web 2.0 environments. The evolution has influenced how environmental websites are built and assessed for their impact on user engagement and decision-making processes.</p>

        <h2>Foundations of Web Analysis</h2>
        <p>This section evaluates key principles like URLs for resource identification, HTML for structuring content, and HTTP as the communication protocol. These principles underlie the ability to standardize and assess web functionality and impact effectively.</p>

        <h2>Future Trends</h2>
        <p>The paper explores how semantic technologies can better structure unstructured data on websites. Enhancements to frameworks like PROMETHEE II improve decision-making by offering more robust and scalable approaches for data modeling and user interaction.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, web applications continue to evolve, focusing on agility, user engagement, and scalable data management. Evaluations like those offered by PROMETHEE II provide valuable insights for improving environmental websites and their influence on user behavior.</p>
